## Tools
Any parallelization method can be used. The solution must work on the **Para** cluster.

## Help
The source program **fractal.ccp** is a serial version of a Mandelbrot set generartor.
The **Makefile** provides help for compiling and running the serial version.
**fractal.sh** is a utility to run the serial version in batch mode.

The above files may be modified depending on the parallelization method used.
The generated file size also can be freely modified to make the measurement more accurate.
Make several measurements with different processor numbers to determine the speedup curve.


## To be submitted
Source files of the solution and a documentation/presentation describing the solution and measurement method, including the measurement results and their interpretation.
